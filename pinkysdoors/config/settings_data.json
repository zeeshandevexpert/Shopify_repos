With flatbed orders, a PINKYS representative will be contacting you via phone to discuss the process before having the order picked up. once PINKYS gets the ok from you, the customer, to put your load up for bid, the order will take anywhere between 1-4 days (sometimes more depending on destination, sizing, and time of year) to get picked up from our warehouse. once picked up, the flatbed driver will contact you 24 hours out from delivery. There is no set date\/time for flatbed deliveries. It is your responsibility to make sure you are there for offload at the time the driver arrives. You will have 30-45 minutes to offload your order. Most of our doors require 2-3 (sometimes 4) able bodied persons to lift and remove doors and frames from the flatbed. For larger orders, please make sure you have more manpower in order to offload within the time limits.
