Inspired by her previous handiwork and using a similar concept, she hand-made Devon and Sydney their first iPhone cases.</p><p>Upon seeing the cases that Michelle designed, Sydney and Devon freaked out, as did their circle of friends at high school. Soon Michelle started hand-making extra cases so if someone wanted to buy them off of her, they could. Two weeks later at a local restaurant, the the Carlsons unexpectedly ran into Miley Cyrus who, after seeing the cases, freaked out and inspired Michelle and her daughters to create a website and start selling the cases. </p>"
